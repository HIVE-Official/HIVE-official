## About Page Copy

### What This Is
HIVE is campus infrastructure built by students.

Not another social app trying to "disrupt" college.
Not corporate software that misses the point.

Just the platform we needed, so we built it.

### Why We Built This
Because GroupMe wasn't made for event planning.
Because Discord wasn't made for class coordination.
Because every campus portal feels like it's from 2005.

We're students at UB who got tired of forcing 
apps to do things they weren't built for.

So we built something that was.

### How It's Different
You don't just use HIVE. You build it.

Need a way to coordinate study groups? 
Build a coordination tool.

Want better event planning?
Build an event tool.

Works for your group? 
Everyone gets access to it.

It's Lego blocks for campus life.
Simple pieces that combine into exactly what you need.
