## 🎬 The Brutal Truth

**HIVE succeeds when:**
- Jake finds a party and gets laid
- Sarah finds study partners and passes
- Mike joins a food run and saves money
- Emma finds a ride home
- Alex knows where everyone is tonight

**HIVE fails when:**
- We talk about "sovereignty"
- Posts don't save
- No notifications
- Too complex
- Not fun

**Build for Jake, Sarah, Mike, Emma, and Alex.**
**Not for the vision. For them.**
