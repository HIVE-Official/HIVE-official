The goal is to keep plants alive and healthy by itself over long periods of time (such as over a winter or summer break). The goal for this year is to create a basic structure that can grow foods such as grape tomatoes and basil. This project is looking for people interested in web development, embedded systems, Internet of Things (IoT), gardening, sustainability, and building!&nbsp; &nbsp; From Wednesday, October 29, 2025 4:30 PM to 7:30 PM EDT at Bonner 416 .",

For those P4s that are interested we can make accommodations to allow you to compete virtually if you are not in the Buffalo area. The counseling competition starts at the local level here at UB, and there are a total of two rounds. Both rounds are run similarly to the counseling sessions that you complete in your Patient Care Essentials classes. The preliminary round includes a basic prescription that you, as the student pharmacist, have to counsel a mock patient on. You will receive time to review any drug database of your choosing to prepare what you would like to convey to the patient, similar to a real-life scenario.</p>\n<p>Please note that you do not need extensive clinical knowledge to compete in this competition! The goal of this is to practice how you convey information to a patient and how you utilize your communication skills. From the preliminary round, the top ten students chosen by our pharmacist judges will move on to the final round here at UB. The final round will be run very similarly to the first round; however, it will be more challenging. The winner of the final round will have the chance of representing the University at Buffalo School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at the APhA annual meeting by competing in a virtual preliminary round. If the<br />winner makes it past the virtual round, they will get to compete against other students from all over the country! The top ten finalists in the national competition will get recognized during the awards celebration at the annual meeting and even receive cash prizes!</p>\n<p>This is a great way to practice counseling without a formal grade for a class, allowing you to just have a conversation with a patient! Both rounds will be held in the patient assessment room, so it should feel very familiar to what you have already been doing in your classes. Each round will be recorded as well, so there is<br />no pressure of judges watching you as you counsel.</p></div>\n  <div>\n    <p>\n      From <time class=\"dt-start dtstart\" datetime=\"2025-10-30T15:00:00.0000000-04:00\" title=\"2025-10-30T15:00:00.0000000-04:00\">Thursday, October 30, 2025 3:00 PM</time>\n      to <time class=\"dt-end dtend\" datetime=\"2025-10-30T16:00:00.0000000-04:00\" title=\"2025-10-30T16:00:00.0000000-04:00\">4:00 PM EDT</time>\n      at <span class=\"p-location location\">PB 250</span>.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</div>",

From the preliminary round, the top ten students chosen by our pharmacist judges will move on to the final round here at UB. The final round will be run very similarly to the first round; however, it will be more challenging. The winner of the final round will have the chance of representing the University at Buffalo School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at the APhA annual meeting by competing in a virtual preliminary round. If the winner makes it past the virtual round, they will get to compete against other students from all over the country! The top ten finalists in the national competition will get recognized during the awards celebration at the annual meeting and even receive cash prizes! This is a great way to practice counseling without a formal grade for a class, allowing you to just have a conversation with a patient! Both rounds will be held in the patient assessment room, so it should feel very familiar to what you have already been doing in your classes. Each round will be recorded as well, so there is no pressure of judges watching you as you counsel. From Thursday, October 30, 2025 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM EDT at PB 250 .",

This workshop lasts for two hours every week, where students have a focused time to write academic materials, like drafts of research papers, research proposals, dissertations, course assignments, or any other writing.

For those P4s that are interested we can make accommodations to allow you to compete virtually if you are not in the Buffalo area. The counseling competition starts at the local level here at UB, and there are a total of two rounds. Both rounds are run similarly to the counseling sessions that you complete in your Patient Care Essentials classes. The preliminary round includes a basic prescription that you, as the student pharmacist, have to counsel a mock patient on. You will receive time to review any drug database of your choosing to prepare what you would like to convey to the patient, similar to a real-life scenario.</p>\n<p>Please note that you do not need extensive clinical knowledge to compete in this competition! The goal of this is to practice how you convey information to a patient and how you utilize your communication skills. From the preliminary round, the top ten students chosen by our pharmacist judges will move on to the final round here at UB. The final round will be run very similarly to the first round; however, it will be more challenging. The winner of the final round will have the chance of representing the University at Buffalo School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at the APhA annual meeting by competing in a virtual preliminary round. If the<br />winner makes it past the virtual round, they will get to compete against other students from all over the country! The top ten finalists in the national competition will get recognized during the awards celebration at the annual meeting and even receive cash prizes!</p>\n<p>This is a great way to practice counseling without a formal grade for a class, allowing you to just have a conversation with a patient! Both rounds will be held in the patient assessment room, so it should feel very familiar to what you have already been doing in your classes. Each round will be recorded as well, so there is<br />no pressure of judges watching you as you counsel.</p></div>\n  <div>\n    <p>\n      From <time class=\"dt-start dtstart\" datetime=\"2025-11-20T15:00:00.0000000-05:00\" title=\"2025-11-20T15:00:00.0000000-05:00\">Thursday, November 20, 2025 3:00 PM</time>\n      to <time class=\"dt-end dtend\" datetime=\"2025-11-20T16:00:00.0000000-05:00\" title=\"2025-11-20T16:00:00.0000000-05:00\">4:00 PM EST</time>\n      at <span class=\"p-location location\">PB 250</span>.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</div>",

The counseling competition starts at the local level here at UB, and there are a total of two rounds. Both rounds are run similarly to the counseling sessions that you complete in your Patient Care Essentials classes. The preliminary round includes a basic prescription that you, as the student pharmacist, have to counsel a mock patient on. You will receive time to review any drug database of your choosing to prepare what you would like to convey to the patient, similar to a real-life scenario. Please note that you do not need extensive clinical knowledge to compete in this competition! The goal of this is to practice how you convey information to a patient and how you utilize your communication skills. From the preliminary round, the top ten students chosen by our pharmacist judges will move on to the final round here at UB. The final round will be run very similarly to the first round; however, it will be more challenging. The winner of the final round will have the chance of representing the University at Buffalo School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at the APhA annual meeting by competing in a virtual preliminary round. If the winner makes it past the virtual round, they will get to compete against other students from all over the country! The top ten finalists in the national competition will get recognized during the awards celebration at the annual meeting and even receive cash prizes! This is a great way to practice counseling without a formal grade for a class, allowing you to just have a conversation with a patient! Both rounds will be held in the patient assessment room, so it should feel very familiar to what you have already been doing in your classes. Each round will be recorded as well, so there is no pressure of judges watching you as you counsel. From Thursday, November 20, 2025 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM EST at PB 250 .",
