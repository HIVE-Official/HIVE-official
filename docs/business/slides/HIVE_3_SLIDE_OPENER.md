# HIVE — 3‑Slide Opener

## Slide 1 — Category and Promise
- Category: Campus OS — run by students
- One‑liner: Students run campus. HIVE is the OS.
- Mission: Give students true ownership of campus life—so communities, events, and culture can run themselves with clarity, trust, and speed.

Speaker note: Anchor the room on student ownership. We are not “another app”; we are the operating system students use to run campus life end‑to‑end.

## Slide 2 — Pillars and UVP
- Pillars: Student‑Owned · Tech‑Sleek · Trust‑Visible · Living Platform
- UVP:
  - Sovereign Spaces — communities control membership, norms, events, resources
  - Campus‑wide Voice — Rituals surface what students want next
  - Distribution that works — the Feed replaces flyers and link dumps
  - Extensions, not complexity — HiveLab adds tools with roles/permissions and versioning

Speaker note: Contrast with legacy tools. Emphasize that sovereignty and distribution are solved together, not traded off.

## Slide 3 — HiveLab Intrigue
- Today: Students extend Spaces with lightweight Tools and shareable extensions
- Tomorrow: A canvas for student‑built capabilities that may travel beyond a single Space
- Guardrails: Don’t overclaim; let students discover its potential. Keep Rituals campus‑wide, never tucked inside Spaces.

Speaker note: Leave the audience curious. We are building the extension layer in the open with students.
