# Spaces — Public Spec (Outsider Overview)

- One‑liner: Spaces are sovereign homes for student communities on HIVE.
- Status: Early access (pre‑GA). UB launch is pre‑seeded with 200+ Spaces.
- Positioning: Student‑owned, tech‑sleek, trust‑visible. Calm core; fast paths to action.

## What Spaces Are

- Sovereign homes for clubs, halls, orgs, and communities.
- Visible roles (e.g., leader, officer, member) with role‑aware actions.
- Clear norms: short rules sheet before first post; reversible moderation where possible.
- The Space stream stays useful: ≤2 pins that auto‑expire; posts and events reach the right people.
- A right-side Dock for Tools and Resources where action happens (rides, forms, sign‑ups, docs).

## How Students Use Spaces (Day‑One Flow)

- Discover: Recommended tab highlights what’s active and relevant; joined Spaces are excluded.
- Join: Open by default for campus Spaces; Request for Residential & Greek by safety posture; Invite‑only where needed.
- Participate: Tap once to RSVP (with undo), react, and post; see outcomes and updates in one place.
- Find depth: Open an event or post for details without losing your place in the stream.

## Leader Experience (Run Your Org End‑to‑End)

- Setup: Choose join policy (Open / Request / Invite‑only); define simple rules; assign roles.
- Run: Post updates, schedule events, pin what matters (auto‑expires), manage Tools and Resources.
- Coordinate: One‑tap RSVP and check‑ins give reliable counts without spreadsheet churn.
- Safety: Media from non‑leaders can require approval; reports are handled with transparent, reversible actions.

## Why Spaces Are Different

- Student‑Owned: Creation and governance live with students, not gatekeepers.
- Distribution That Works: Events and messages reach people fast where they already are—no flyers, no link dumps.
- Trust‑Visible: Verified presence, clear roles, policy‑aware flows, and reversible actions.
- Extensions, Not Complexity: HiveLab adds Tools and extensions with roles/permissions and versioning—useful today, room to grow.

## UB Launch (What to Expect)

- Pre‑seeded breadth: 200+ Spaces at kickoff (flagship clubs, residence halls, identity orgs, service, intramural, Greek councils).
- Safety posture: Campus Spaces default Open; Residential & Greek default Request; Invite‑only available for sensitive groups.
- Week‑one activation: A campus‑wide Ritual creates a shared moment and distribution spike; outcomes are handed back to Spaces.
- Support: Student core team co‑pilots onboarding; leaders get a short setup checklist and real fixtures on day one.

## What Changes vs Today

- Flyers/Stories/link dumps → A Feed that reaches the right people in minutes.
- Google Forms + Sheets + QR codes → One‑tap RSVP with undo; clear counts; check‑ins when it matters.
- Discord/GroupMe chaos → Sovereign Spaces with visible roles, light‑touch rules, and transparent moderation.
- Linktree/Notion/Drive sprawl → Tools and Resources where action happens—inside the Space.
- Polls in random channels → Campus‑wide Rituals that collect a signal and hand outcomes back (separate from Spaces).

## Guardrails & Trust

- Campus isolation: Each campus is its own environment; ranking and rules respect that boundary.
- Policy‑aware flows: Friendly pre‑flight cues reduce mistakes; hard stops only where needed.
- Transparent moderation: Actions are visible; reversibility where possible maintains trust.
- Verified presence: Recognized orgs can be marked verified; roles are visible to members.

## Roadmap (Near‑Term)

- Recommended blend: Activity + affinity ranking with caps so quieter identity groups surface.
- Context‑aware Tools: Only show what’s relevant in the Dock to reduce noise.
- Calendar clarity: List for near‑term; Month for planning; subtle check‑in prompts for attendance confidence.
- Policy transparency: Short rules sheet with examples before first post; clearer feedback on outcomes.

## What We Measure (Outcomes)

- Discovery → Join conversion; joins/week per campus.
- Time‑to‑reach for posts; RSVP → Check‑in conversion; pin CTR.
- Report ratio and moderation latency; composer starts → publishes.

## FAQ (Public)

- Is this another chat app? No. Spaces are part of a Campus OS with a real public square and campus‑wide Rituals.
- Can anyone create a Space? Students lead creation. Verification is available for recognized orgs.
- How safe is it? Clear roles, policy‑aware flows, and transparent, reversible moderation are built‑in.
- Does this replace university systems? It complements them. Students own the community layer; universities keep safety rails.
- Are Rituals part of Spaces? No. Rituals run campus‑wide, time‑boxed, and return outcomes to the community.
- When is it available? Early access and rolling out. UB launches with 200+ pre‑seeded Spaces; request your campus to get prioritized.
