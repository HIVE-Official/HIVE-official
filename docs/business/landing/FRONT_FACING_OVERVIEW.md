# HIVE — Campus OS (Public Overview)

- One‑liner: Campus OS — run by students.
- Status: Early access. Rolling out to select campuses. Request your campus.

## Why HIVE (Today, Not Someday)

- Campus runs on flyers, link dumps, and group chats. It’s noisy and slow.
- HIVE puts students in charge with a calm core and fast paths to action.
- You get distribution that works, ownership that’s visible, and a campus‑wide voice.

## What Changes This Week (Map from Today → HIVE)

- Flyers/Stories/Link spam → A Feed that actually reaches the right people fast.
- Google Forms + Sheets + QR codes → One‑tap RSVP with undo and clear counts; check‑ins when it matters.
- Discord/GroupMe chaos → Sovereign Spaces with visible roles, light‑touch rules, and reversible moderation.
- Linktree/Notion/Drive sprawl → Dock with Tools and Resources where people already act.
- Polls in random channels → Campus‑wide Rituals that collect a signal and hand outcomes back.

## Who It’s For (Value, Not Features)

- Students
  - Find your people fast; see what’s happening without chasing links.
  - Tap to RSVP, change your mind, and get reminders when it helps.
  - Steer what’s next through campus‑wide Rituals—no permission required.
- Leaders
  - Run your org end‑to‑end in your Space: roles, events, posts, light moderation.
  - Replace forms + spreadsheets with quick actions; show outcomes clearly.
  - Add extensions when needed without bloating the core.
- Universities
  - Healthier participation with less overhead; clear norms and visible outcomes.
  - Students own culture; you keep safety rails and policy guardrails.
  - Campus‑level Rituals surface what students want next—useful signal.

## What HIVE Is (Conceptual)

- Spaces: Sovereign homes for communities (clubs, halls, orgs) with membership, norms, and visible roles.
- Feed: The campus public square where events and messages distribute—no flyers, no link dumps.
- Rituals: Campus‑wide, time‑boxed experiences that collect participation and hand outcomes back—the campus mic. Not a Space feature.
- HiveLab: Lightweight Tools and extensions students add today—designed to grow with ambition tomorrow. We won’t overclaim.

## Why We’re Different

- Student‑Owned: Creation and governance live with students, not gatekeepers.
- Tech‑Sleek: Calm core, precise interactions, fast paths to action.
- Trust‑Visible: Verified presence, clear roles, transparent moderation, reversible actions.
- Living Platform: Continuously updated to mirror campus energy and needs.

## How It Feels

- Calm core. Wild edges. Clear lanes, quick actions, and undo built‑in.
- Friction where it protects trust; speed where it drives momentum.

## Rollout & Access

- First public release (pre‑GA). Not broadly available yet.
- Use “rolling out,” “request your campus,” and “early access” language.
- Request your campus to get prioritized when HIVE lands at your university.

## Calls to Action

- Get in → Join early access.
- Request your campus → Bring HIVE to your university.
- Partner with us → Student leaders and campus teams co‑pilot rollouts.

## Boilerplate (PR/Investor)

HIVE is the Campus OS run by students. Spaces give communities the sovereignty to run themselves, the Feed is the campus public square where events actually reach people, HiveLab lets students extend the platform with tools and extensions, and Rituals are campus‑wide experiences that surface the community’s will—guiding what campus and the platform do next. Tech‑sleek, trust‑visible, and continuously updated to match campus energy. Early access; request your campus.

## Proof Hooks (placeholders — replace with telemetry)

- “Replaced flyers for X orgs in 14 days.”
- “Y% of posts reach the right audience in 5 minutes.”
- “Z% of freshmen joined 3+ Spaces in week one.”
