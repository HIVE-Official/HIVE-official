## HIVE — Campus OS (Brand Primer)

Category
- Campus OS — run by students.

One-liner
- Students run campus. HIVE is the OS.

Mission
- Give students true ownership of campus life—so communities, events, and culture can run themselves with clarity, trust, and speed.

Vision
- A student-governed Campus OS: Spaces are sovereign homes for clubs/orgs/halls; the Feed is the public square where events actually reach people; Rituals are campus-wide experiences that surface what students want next; and HiveLab is the extension layer students use to shape HIVE today—and perhaps much more tomorrow.

Brand Pillars
- Student-Owned — Creation and governance live with students, not gatekeepers.
- Tech-Sleek — Calm core, precise interactions, fast paths to action.
- Trust-Visible — Verified presence, clear roles, transparent moderation, reversible actions.
- Living Platform — Continuously updated to mirror campus energy and needs.

UVP (why we’re different)
- Sovereign Spaces. Clubs and communities actually control their homes—membership, norms, events, resources.
- Campus-wide Voice. Rituals (e.g., Campus Madness: Top Space of the Year, Vote the next feature, Anonymous Hour) run at the campus level—signal that directs what happens next.
- Distribution that works. The Feed replaces flyers and link dumps; events and messages reach people fast, where they already are.
- Extensions, not complexity. HiveLab lets students add Tools and extensions with roles/permissions and versioning—usable today inside Spaces, designed to grow with ambition.

HiveLab (leave intrigue, not promises)
- Today: Students extend their Spaces with lightweight Tools and shareable extensions.
- Tomorrow: HiveLab’s canvas hints at something bigger—student-built capabilities that might travel beyond any single Space. We won’t overclaim; we’ll let students discover what it can become.

Rituals (clear separation from Spaces)
- Campus-wide, time-boxed experiences that collect participation at the university level and hand outcomes back to the community (e.g., platform priorities, campus spotlights). Not a Space feature, not a poll—the campus mic.

Value Proposition (audience-focused)
- Students — Join Spaces that matter, see what’s happening, and steer what’s next through Rituals—no waiting for permission.
- Leaders — Run your org end-to-end inside your Space; add extensions when needed; show outcomes clearly.
- Universities — Healthier participation and clearer norms with less overhead. Students own culture; you keep safety rails.

Positioning Lines (use in deck/site)
- Campus, but student-run.
- Calm core. Wild edges.
- No flyers. No gatekeepers. Just momentum.
- Built for trust. Built to evolve.

Landing Hero (copy-ready)
- H1: Campus OS — run by students.
- Sub: Student-owned. Tech-sleek. Trust-visible. Always evolving.
- CTA: Get in →
- Secondary: See what’s happening today →

Boilerplate (PR/Investor)
- HIVE is the Campus OS run by students. Spaces give communities the sovereignty to run themselves, the Feed is the campus public square where events actually reach people, HiveLab lets students extend the platform with tools and extensions, and Rituals are campus-wide experiences that surface the community’s will—guiding what campus and the platform do next. Tech-sleek, trust-visible, and continuously updated to match campus energy.

Proof Hooks (brand-level)
- “Replaced flyers for X orgs in 14 days.”
- “Y% of posts reach the right audience in 5 minutes.”
- “Z% of freshmen joined 3+ Spaces in week one.”

Guardrails
- Don’t claim HiveLab “runs the whole campus” yet; imply potential.
- Keep Rituals clearly campus-wide (never tucked inside Spaces).
- Hammer student-run and living platform on every surface.
