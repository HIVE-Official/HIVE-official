- Purpose (1–2 sentences):
- IA placement (where it’s used):
- States (loading/empty/error/success/edge):
- Variants (keep minimal):
- A11y (roles, labels, keyboard, SR, contrast):
- Motion (micro/macro, reduced‑motion fallback):
- Token hooks (colors, radius, elevation, spacing, ring):
- Dependencies (atoms/molecules):
- Alternatives considered (compose from existing?):
- Risks (privacy, dark pattern adjacency, performance):
- Test plan (unit/a11y/story states):
- Decision (Approved/Rejected/Needs changes) + Rationale:

Submission rule: If rejected, compose from existing Canon. If approved, add to docs/design/CANON_MOLECULES.md and create Storybook stories with full state coverage.
