# HIVE: The Social Utility Platform

## Core Vision
**"Where connections form around solving real problems together"**

HIVE isn't another social network or study app. It's where college students actually get things done - together.

## What is Social Utility?

### The Problem with Current Platforms
- **Instagram/TikTok**: Entertainment and vanity metrics, no real utility
- **Discord**: Great for chat, but not for organizing real-world activities
- **GroupMe**: Just messaging, no tools or discovery
- **Facebook Groups**: Outdated, cluttered, not mobile-first
- **Craigslist/Facebook Marketplace**: Utility without social trust

### HIVE's Sweet Spot
```
SOCIAL UTILITY = Real Connections + Practical Solutions + Campus Trust
```

## Summary

HIVE is building something entirely new: a platform where social connections have immediate, practical value. Every interaction solves a problem. Every connection creates opportunity. Every tool makes campus life better.

We're not competing with Instagram for attention or with Canvas for academics. We're creating the space where real college life happens - the deals, the rides, the parties, the opportunities, the connections that actually matter.

This is social utility. This is HIVE.
