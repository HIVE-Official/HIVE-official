## 🎯 **Strategic Organization Goals**

### **User Journey Focused**
Each section follows the natural progression of HIVE usage:
1. **Foundation** → Understanding design principles
2. **Components** → Building blocks for interfaces  
3. **Interfaces** → Complete user experiences
4. **Visual Improvements** → Future iterations

### **Campus Context**
Every story includes real campus scenarios:
- Study group coordination
- Space management workflows
- Student profile interactions
- Campus event planning
- Resource sharing patterns

### **Design System Consistency**
All components demonstrate:
- Strategic gold usage (hover/focus/achievement states)
- HIVE motion system (180ms, organic curves)
- Design token architecture
- Campus energy personality
