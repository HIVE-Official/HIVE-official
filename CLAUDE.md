## Collaboration Approach

### Working with Claude

- When working on tasks, ask me questions before hand - because I will be the sole dev.

### Design System Evolution Rule

- **NEVER build components in isolation** - every new component must enhance and evolve our existing design system
- **ALWAYS ask before building**: "Should this component update our brand system? Should we audit existing patterns first?"
- **DESIGN SYSTEM FIRST**: When building new components, first audit how they connect to existing patterns, then build in a way that improves the entire system
- **COMPONENT INTERCONNECTION**: New components must work beautifully with existing components and establish patterns for future ones
- **EVOLUTIONARY APPROACH**: Each component should make the entire HIVE design system better, not just add to it

### Project Guidelines

- You must follow all md to see where we are in project and follow foundations of HIVE
- When building a page, you must never hardcode. Work within our system or build within our system.
