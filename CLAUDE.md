## Collaboration Approach

### Working with Claude

- When working on tasks, ask me questions before hand - because I will be the sole dev.
- When adding pages to the live router, ask me business logic questions first for clarity 

### Design System Evolution Rule

- **NEVER build components in isolation** - every new component must enhance and evolve our existing design system
- **ALWAYS ask before building**: "Should this component update our brand system? Should we audit existing patterns first?"
- **DESIGN SYSTEM FIRST**: When building new components, first audit how they connect to existing patterns, then build in a way that improves the entire system
- **COMPONENT INTERCONNECTION**: New components must work beautifully with existing components and establish patterns for future ones
- **EVOLUTIONARY APPROACH**: Each component should make the entire HIVE design system better, not just add to it

### Project Guidelines

- You must follow all md to see where we are in project and follow foundations of HIVE
- When building a page, you must never hardcode. Work within our system or build within our system.

### Product Architecture Approach

- Always think like a product architect

### Platform Component Principles

- Important that all components when built are considering other parts of the platform for leverage and no redundancy.

### Startup Journey

- We are building a startup.

### Platform Vision

- Hive's UI and UX has to remember that it is a social media platform blended with utility.

### Development Principles

- You do not build any "mock" or stub features/functionality. We build for production.
