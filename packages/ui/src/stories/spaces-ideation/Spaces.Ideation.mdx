<Title>Spaces — Layouts & Interfaces (Ideation)</Title>

<Subtitle>Calm shell, fast actions, student‑first.</Subtitle>

<Description>
This is our working canvas to converge on Space layouts and interactions before deep implementation. See the full brief at <code>docs/design/spaces/SPACES_LAYOUTS_AND_INTERFACES_IDEATION.md</code>.

Key principles:
- Calm Core: sticky header + feed/rail grid using shell tokens.
- Purposeful Motion: slower, readable; compact header on scroll.
- Extensions, not apps: Tools show as actions/rail widgets.
- Trust‑Visible: roles/policies surfaced via friendly InlineNotice.
</Description>

## Surfaces (vNext)

- Header & Tabs — identity, verified chip, actions, rail toggle; tabs are feed‑scoped.
- Feed (Post Stream) — Standard, Announcement, Poll, Event cards; PinnedCluster ≤ 2; Composer at bottom.
- Chat (Optional) — channel‑like grouping, newest at bottom, “Jump to present”.
- Events — List/Month + detail sheet with RSVP → Undo.
- Members — roster with role filters and quick actions.
- About & Resources — identity, featured links, pinned resources.
- Tools — catalog, install, and surface as actions.
- Moderation — media/queue with quick decisions.
- Settings — visibility, join/posting policies, roles.

## Acceptance Themes

- Header compact‑on‑scroll; tabs sticky; consistent baselines.
- Keyboard traversal across feed; focus visible; Esc closes sheets.
- PinnedCluster never > 2; respects expiry in fixtures.
- No glossy sheens; gold CTAs remain static.

## Try the Frame

Use the “Spaces/Ideation/Frame” stories to toggle density, rail, and mode (feed/chat/events/members) and sketch variations.
