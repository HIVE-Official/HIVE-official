# Route Transition Matrix

All transitions are calm-first, HC/RM compliant, and depth-honest. Timings map to tokens. RM substitutes transform with short fades.

| From ⇄ To | Primitive | Duration | Easing/Spring | Elevation | Scrim/Blur | RM Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Feed ⇄ Space | routeCrossfade | md (180ms) | standard | E0 → E0 | none | fadeIn xs |
| Space ⇄ Tool | liftY (8px) | md (180ms) | decel | E0 → E1 | none | fadeIn sm |
| Space ⇄ Profile | routeCrossfade + active tab glide | md (180ms) | standard | E0 | none | fadeIn xs |
| Space ⇄ Ritual | fadeScale | lg (220ms) | decel | E0 → E2 (if panel) | overlay if modal | fadeIn sm |
| Dialog (desktop) | sheetRight | lg (220ms) | SPRING.overlay | E4 | scrim-overlay + scrim-blur | fadeIn sm, no blur |
| Sheet (mobile) | sheetUp | lg (220ms) | SPRING.overlay | E4 | scrim-overlay + scrim-blur | fadeIn sm, no blur |

Notes
- HC: `.high-contrast` disables blur for glass/scrim.
- No-glass: `.no-glass` removes backdrop blur globally.
- Performance mode: `[data-glass-mode="performance"]` removes heavy blur on mobile.
