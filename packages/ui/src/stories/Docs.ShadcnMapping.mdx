# Shadcn Mapping (Hive)

- Import via `@/atoms` or `@/index`; avoid `@/components/ui/*` outside atoms.
- Tokens from `@hive/tokens` drive surfaces, borders, rings, motion, and typography.
- Dials in the toolbar adjust radius, density, elevation, glass, contrast, motion.

## Curated primitives

Button, Input, Textarea, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Switch, Label, Badge, Card, Separator, Skeleton, Progress, Slider, Toggle, Tooltip, Avatar.

## Overlays & Menus

Dialog, Sheet, DropdownMenu, Command (Combobox), Tabs, Select, Popover.

## Customizations

- Focus-ring: 2px token ring; offset for clarity.
- Glass surfaces: use elevation-aware utilities: `glass-subtle`, `glass-float`, `glass-elevated`, `glass-command`. Legacy `surface-glass` still supported; disable via `.no-glass`.
- Motion: canonical 100–600ms scale (common: 150/200/300/400ms), easings tokenized; reduced-motion respected.
- Density: 0.92/1/1.08 scales for typography and spacing.
