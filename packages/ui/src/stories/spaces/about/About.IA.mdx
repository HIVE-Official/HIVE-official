# About IA — Space Identity & Credibility

Purpose
- Space identity and credibility card for students, leaders, and downstream modules.
- Clear, policy‑aware information that helps students decide to join and contribute.

Route & Surfaces
- Route: `/space/:id/about` (spec). Current app path aligns: `/spaces/[spaceId]/about`.
- Surfaces: Full About page and a 3‑line Context Rail preview with a “View full about” affordance.

Above the fold (full page)
- Name • type • verified badge; quick stats (members, upcoming events count).
- Overview (rich text), Tags (3–8), Links (allow‑listed), Policies summary (join, posting, visibility, media policy).

Editing & Roles
- Leaders can edit description, tags, and featured links (inline for v1).
- Members/Guests read only; contacts redacted for non‑campus (future policy plumbing).

Safety & Lints
- Link allowlist + https‑only; friendly errors on blocked domains.
- Upcoming: profanity/PII, contrast, length guidance.

Versioning
- Save appends an audit/version entry (leaders can view log in a later flag).
