# Dock IA (right-side)

- Purpose: actionable widgets for a Space (Calendar, Members, About, Tools/Resources when relevant).
- Brand posture: calm core, fast paths to action. Information stays scannable; avoid dashboard overload.

## Layout Variants

- Standard (sticky, scrollable contents): desktop 60/40 or 65/35 split. Dock sticks under header; inner content scrolls when long.
- Compact (non‑scrollable): prioritized widgets only; useful for tighter layouts or when the feed must dominate.
- Mobile Drawer/Sheet: Dock opens from a sheet instead of stacking below the feed.

### Standard Sticky

<Canvas>
  <Story of={LayoutStories.StandardSticky} />
  <ArgsTable of={LayoutStories.default} />
  
</Canvas>

### Compact

<Canvas>
  <Story of={LayoutStories.CompactNoScroll} />
</Canvas>

### Mobile Drawer

<Canvas>
  <Story of={LayoutStories.MobileDrawer} />
</Canvas>

## Notes

- Members search is present even in the preview to drive quick lookups; full roster is a click‑through.
- Calendar preview caps visible rows; “View all” elevates Events when a Space is event‑heavy.
- About is intentionally short (3 lines); deep details live on the About page.
- Ordering of widgets flips in chat‑mode versus feed‑mode at the layout level, not inside the Dock component.
