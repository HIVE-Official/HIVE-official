# 👤 Profile System

**Campus identity. Show who you are, what you do, and who you know.**

---

## Overview

The Profile System is the **campus identity layer** for HIVE. Every student has a profile that showcases their identity, activity, connections, and spaces. Designed to be **authentic, not professional** - this is NOT LinkedIn.

## Design Principles

### Authentic, Not Professional
This is NOT LinkedIn:
- ❌ No "seeking opportunities"
- ❌ No "professional headline"
- ❌ No endorsements
- ✅ Real campus identity
- ✅ Casual, friendly tone
- ✅ Actual interests and vibes

### 70% Completion Target
Profiles are useful before 100%:
- Basic info → 30%
- + Avatar → 50%
- + Interests → 70% ✓ (Good enough!)
- + Full bio → 100%

### Social Proof
Show community connections:
- Mutual friends
- Shared spaces
- Common interests
- Activity overlap

### Privacy by Default
Students control visibility:
- Public: Everyone on campus
- Friends: Only connections
- Private: Only me
- Per-field privacy controls
