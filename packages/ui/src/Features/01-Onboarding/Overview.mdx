## Design Principles

### Effortless Competence
Make users feel capable from the start:
- ✅ Pre-filled when possible
- ✅ Clear, simple language
- ✅ Visual progress indicators
- ✅ Immediate positive feedback

### 70% Completion Target
Optimize for finishing, not perfection:
- Students see value before 100% complete
- Can skip non-essential steps
- Return later to complete profile
- No "required field" anxiety

### Social Proof
Show community from the start:
- "Join 5,000 UB students"
- Preview spaces they can join
- Show activity happening now
- Create FOMO (fear of missing out)

### Relief Amplifier
Frame as "someone needs you":
- "Your classmates are waiting"
- "People want to connect with you"
- "You're needed in [Space Name]"
- Creates urgency through community need
